Control
-------

Left or right clicking on a cell rotates four cells inside the frame.
Left rotates counterclockwise, while right rotates clockwise.
If four cells in a row have the same type of image as a result of rotation,
those four cells are erased and cells above them fall down to fill the vacancy.

History
-------

The original game is ten years old and only for Windows if I recall correctly.
I have tried to recreate it in Java applet some time ago for the sake of practice,
but applets turned out to be extinct.
So I ported it to JavaScript and HTML.

Note that I have nothing to do with the original author.
